svncleaner is a command line program that removes the .svn directories from a directories and its subdirectories. I use it to strip the subversion related gunk from the source code that I post on this site because you don't really need to see that.

Directions: Add svncleaner to your PATH. Navigate to the directory you want to strip of .svn directories (I recommend making a copy of the directory and running the program on that since, otherwise, you will delete the .svn directories in your working directory and that would be bad) and run svncleaner.

Notes: This program was tested with Ruby version 1.9
